# Practical Lab on OSPF - Part 2: Area 51

## Areas  

So far, the areas are totally isolated (no interconnection). As you probably have seen in our last lab, it is not possible to join nodes from another area (apart for a direct neighbor... and if you happen to know its correct IP address). Your job is basically to see what's missing and add to add some configurations in order to link these nodes together. 

In order to do that, we need to see how to change the configuration of a router. 

## Router Configuration
In the following questions, you will to have to change the configuration of routers at some point, in particular ABRs (Area Border Routers). Here is a small tutorial on how to do it. 

Connect to OSPFd, in "enable" mode (as explained in Part 1)

It is safer to look at the current configuration before you proceed, with a `show run` (short for `show running-config`). 

To Enter the configuration mode (i.e. change the OSPF configuration):
```console 
root@r5:/# telnet localhost ospfd
Trying 127.0.0.1...
Connected to localhost.
Escape character is '^]'.

Password: 
R5> ena
Password: 
R5# conf t
R5(config)# 
```
(or `conf t` for short). The prompt is now changed (`R5(config)` is now indicated, for R5):
When you move on in the configuration, the prompt might also change to indicate in which part of the configuration you are. Some commands actually depend on the previous ones, for instance in this example: 
```console 
R5(config)# router ospf
R5(config-router)#  
R5(config-router)# exit
R5(config)# exit
R5# 
``` while `exit` will go back one level back-ward (ex: from `config-router` to `config`). Eventually, you can also use `Ctrl-X` to exit from the config mode (wherever deep you were in the configuration hierarchy...) 

As introduced earlier, don't hesitate to use the "?" (on-line help) to see what commands, parameters etc. are requested by the configuration interface. 

### Questions
A quiz is available on moodle. It can be opened simultaneously in another tab (there is no time restriction to answer the quizz). 
You'll have to to answer these questions. Please follow these questions one by one, as they will also help you to get prepared and to progress step by step.

*Question 1*. 
a) Look at both *R2* and *R9*. Which interfaces are participating to OSPF ? (you may use the command `sh ip ospf interface` for instance). 

b) Look at the configurations of these two ABRs. Try to understand how interfaces are configured to participate to the area 0. 

*Question 2*. 
You will understand from Q1 that things are missing in the configuration. Please configure *R2* in order to enable OSPF on all its interfaces. (You'll be asked to provide the OSPF modifications). Verify that OSPF is now enabled on all its interfaces (except `dummy0` of course). 

*Question 3*. Configure also R6. Observe the ospf database now (on either R2 and R6). How many additional LSAs are now available in Area 0 (after adding R6) ? Observe the routing table of R8. 

*Question 4. Aggregation*. There are now many routes exchanged as "summary" routes. It can be better to "aggregate" these summary routes: for instance all the routes from *Area 10* could be aggregated as a single prefix `10.10.0.0/16`. Similarly, *Area 10* does not need to have all the details of *Area 0*, which could be summarised as `10.0.0.0/16`. Configure the ABR R2 and R6 in order to use aggregation. This can be achieved with the followin command:

```console
router ospf
 (...)
 area 10 range (... address prefix to be defined...)
```
Provide the OSPF configuration of R2. Verify the OSPF databases. 

*Question 5. Stub Area*.  Let's now configure the area as a "stub" as shown hereafter (note that all the routers in area 10: R2,R6, R8 and R9 shall be configured): 
```console
router ospf
 (...)
 area 10 stub
```
What has changed in the OSPF database ? 

*Question 6 (Optional/Bonus)*.   

![Warning. Alien activities](./images/alien.png "Warning. Alien activities")

 This mysterious question is optional (answering it will provide a small bonus). 
 Configure *Area 51* as a stub area with aggregation (as for AS10). Then look at the routing table of R12 and R1. Do you think something missing in R1 ? Some rumours claim that a route has disappeared, and that's because of this damned [Area 51](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area_51) where strange things happen. Some even say that the Aliens have abducted an Link state ??? 
 What about you ? Is it due to the aliens ? If not, do you know a way to get this route back (not configuration needed, just explain what should be done) ?
