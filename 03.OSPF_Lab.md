# Practical Lab on OSPF - Part 1: Area 0

## Topology Considered
We will consider the following topology.

![Topology considered](./images/area51.png "Topology considered")

The network consists of 11 routers located in three different areas. The backbone area (area 0) contains R1, R2, ... R6. Area 10 contains R2, R6, R8 and R9. And finally Areea 51 contains R10, R11, R12, R3 and R5. Note that we don't why there is no R7, through some people claim that it was abducted by Aliens (when trying to visit Area 51).  

IPv4 Addresses are assigned in a very simple way, for instance router 1 interface connecting to R5 will be 10.0.15.1/24, corresponding to: 10.(area 0).(from 1 to 5).(1 because it's R1). With the notable exception of subnet 10.0.10.0/24 which is the central LAN containing both R1,R2 and R3. Each router is configured with a "pseudo" interface: 10.0.0.1 for R1, ..., 10.0.0.6 for R6, 10.10.0.8 for R8, ..., 10.51.0.10 for R10 etc.  These interface-independant addresses are used as OSPF Router IDs. For more details on the addressing plan, see the Appendix at the bottom of this page. 

All the routers are pre-configured with interfaces already configured and OSPF enabled. We'll thus be able to play a little bit with OSPF and observe LSAs, adjacencies, etc. 

In this first part, we shall concentrate on Area 0 (only). 

## Network Tool 

All the routers are in fact small Docker containers running the open-source routing suite "Quagga". They are configured and launched automatically to fit with our desired topology thanks to the "Kathara" tool. 

### Starting the lab
You first need to download the lab folder from Moodle. Unzip it. Using a terminal, enter this "Lab" directory (for instance with "cd") and type "kathara lstart".

More information about kathara can be found [here:](https://www.kathara.org/man-pages/kathara.1.html), or just by typing "kathara -h". 
Please note however that we will give you the commands whenever they are needed, so you should not need to read all this (large) documentation. The goal is not to make you router configuration experts, by to play with routers to better understand how it works. 

In a nutshell: 
```console 
kathara lstart : Launch the lab (all the containers)
kathara lclean : Allows to stop all the containers of the lab and delete temp files.
kathara wipe : Allows to stop all the containers "brutally" and clean (wipe) everything (all the modifications made in the different containers will be lost).
kathara list : List all the containers.
kathara connect <name> : allow to connect to machine <name> with a shell (if you closed the windows opened by default when starting the lab). 
```
Attention : For all these commands, it is important to be connected in the Lab directory.


### Linux commands 
The containers also contain classical linux networking tools. You can also check their interfaces with the linux command. Fist connect to one of the router (say r1 here): 
```bash 
kathara connect r1
```
Then to see its different interfaces and associated IP addresses, we can use: 
```
ip addr
```
and its routing table with 
```bash 
ip route
```
To leave this container/router and go back to the lab terminal, simply type `exit`. 

### Quagga

Quagga is a well known open-source routing software suite. It consists of a central process (zebra) which will allow to manage the relation beetween different routing protocols and the linux kernel (in particular for interface management and to instantiate routes in the linux forwarding table). Then several processes can be launched (one for each protocol): ospfd, bgpd, ... 
In this lab, only ospfs is running (since it is an OSPF lab, it seems pretty reasonable). 

Quagga also offers a management interface (usually called CLI: Command Line Interface, where we type specific commands and get the result, similarly to a command terminal in windows or linux). It will be very usefull to monitor OSPF operational data (adjacencies, database) and to configure OSPF.  In order to connect to OSPF CLI, use the command:
```bash
telnet localhost ospfd  
```
(login:zebra, password: zebra)
If you want to exit from OSPFd, just type "exit": you'll return back to the bash shell on the container. 

To find documentation on the OSPFd Quagga CLI, please refer to the official documentation here. Note, that except for a few slight differences, the Quagga CLI is very close to the CLI of a well known router manufacturer from the bay area.  
Here is a list of  the most useful commands. 

You fist need to be connected to the appropriate router/container (`kathara connect r1` for example).

Connect to the ospfd daemon : 
```bash
telnet localhost ospfd
```
you'll then need to connect as "super user" (root), so you need to type `enable`.
```bash
enable 
```
(or "ena" for short) (password is `zebra`, again)
To get the list of IP addresses used on the different OSPF interfaces:
```bash
show ip ospf database
```
To look at its configuration:
```bash 
show running-config
```
To see its routing table:
```bash
show ip ospf route
```
*Remark*. As in commercial routers, it is possible to have help on line with Quagga CLI. Type "?" to see the possible commands, or possible arguments or options of a command. For example `show ip ospf database ?` will give you everything that can be shown (related to the OSPF database). This allows you to find many interesting things, so do not hesitate to be curious and explore Guagga commands with `?`. 

Also automatic completion is possible by typing the "<tab>" key ( "->|" or  "â†¹"  on your keyboard). For instance typing "sh" + <tab> with result in a "show". It does faster and avoids making errors while typing commands. 

## Questions
The following questions are in the quiz which follows. The quiz could be opened simultaneously in another tab in your web browser if you want. 

*Question 1.*: How many LSAs are available in the database (of type *Router* and *Network LSA* in particular) ? 

*Question 2*. Observe the Router LSA generated by R2  with a "show ip ospf database... " What is the difference between a stub and a transit network for you ? 

*Question 3*. Observe the Network LSA corresponding to 10.0.10.0/24 ? How many routers are announced in the 'attached router' section ? 

*Question 4*. Note the 'age' of this last LSA. Do you know what is the usual "max age" (maximum age) of an LSA ?  (Note: it can't be found in the router itself... unfortunately, you have to guess or search on the web). 

*Remark*. As you have seen, we have added pseudo interfaces ("dummy0): it is a virtual interface (named also "loopback" interface on some manufacturers). You have probably also seen that there are announced in OSPF (and are thus in the IP routing table of all the nodes within area0). This is in fact something important. 
Imagine a network monitoring tool. It is regularly geting information on the route (state, number of packets forwarded on each interface, ....). The monitoring tool needs ot be configued with one of the IP address of this equipment (and you should have seen at this stage  that the routers have *many* IP adresses, since they have many interfaces). If we were to use one of the IP address of an interface, then the router would become unreachable when this interface is down... However, if we use a *virtual* interface, independant from any interface, we can keep the connectivity. As long as one interface is available, OSPF will find a route to reach this router. So this is not a *stupid* trick in this lab but a very handsome practical solution ("know-how") for improving reliability...
