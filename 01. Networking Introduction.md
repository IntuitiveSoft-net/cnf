### Pedagogical Objectives

The pedagogical objectives for this exercise session is for you to:

- Understand basic HTTP/1.1 protocol primitives
- Understand some HTTP concepts used extensively (web hosting, caching) 

## Something To Read In The Shower

The HTTP protocol, of which you will be implementing a small part, is documented in full in RFC2616: http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt.

As HTTP is the prevalent application-layer protocol in use on the Internet, it's worth knowing its innards, and you are therefore strongly encouraged to read this document and follow the different activities, for your general culture and education. HTTP is actually everywhere (used for web browsing of course... but not only: it is the protocol used in distributed applications, video on demand, ... ). 

### Necessary Background Information

HTTP uses a client-server model, with each “request” for a page, an image, etc., works like this:

1.The HTTP client opens a connection (TCP) to the HTTP server.
1. The HTTP client sends a "HTTP request" to the HTTP server via that connection.
1. The HTTP server processes the "HTTP request", and sends a "HTTP response" back to the client.
1. The HTTP server eventually closes the connection (after a time-out).

The format of both an HTTP request and an HTTP response is as follows:
   An initial command, followed by `<CR><LF>`
   Zero or more header-lines, of the following format:
                    `Header1: value1 <CR><LF>`
   A blank line, i.e., a line containing nothing other than
                    `<CR><LF>`
An optional message body (query data or query output, such as a HTML file). Figuratively, this looks something like this:
```
    initial command<CR><LF>
    Header1: Value1<CR><LF>
    Header2: Value2<CR><LF>
    Header3: Value3<CR><LF>
    <CR><LF>
    Optional Data
```
`<CR><LF>` means "Carriage-Return Line Feed" - roughly corresponding to "hitting the <ENTER> key on the keyboard". Technically, this corresponds to sending the two ASCII characters with ASCII Values 13 `<CR>` and 10 `<LF>` (`0x0D` and `0x0A` in hexadecimal). This empty line represents the end of the header. 

#### HTTP Requests

In a HTTP request, the initial command looks as follows:
```
          GET <path-to-file> HTTP/1.1
```
`GET` is the most common HTTP request; others include `POST` and `HEAD`. We will consider only `GET` during this exercise.

`<path-to-file>` is the path to the file requested. For example, in an URL such as: `http://www.example.com/mydir/myfile.html`. `<path-to-file>` would be: `/mydir/myfile.html`.

`HTTP/1.1` is the "version number" of the HTTP protocol in use.

A HTTP request, in `HTTP/1.1` MUST also contain the header
```
     Host: <hostname>
```
We will understand the reason for this field latter on (exercice 1.1). 

A complete HTTP request, therefore, can look as follows:
```
     GET / HTTP/1.1<CR><LF>
     Host: www.google.com <CR><LF>
     <CR><LF>
```

#### HTTP Replies

In a HTTP reply, the initial command looks as follows:
```
     HTTP/1.1 <status code> <reason phrase>
```

Again, `HTTP/1.1` indicates the "version number" of the HTTP protocol in use. `<status code>` is a three-digit code that identifies the "kind" of response (error, data, ....), and is structured as follows:
```
     1xx indicates that the message is informational
     2xx indicates "success" (document found, and returned, for example)
     3xx indicates a redirection to another URL (document has moved)
     4xx indicates that there was an error on the client
           (badly formed request, for example)
     5xx indicates an error on the server
<reason phrase> is a humanly-readable message explaining the error code.
```

Commonly seen error codes, and those which you should consider in these exercises, are:
```
     <error code>     <reason phrase>
          200               OK
          301               Moved Permanently
          302               Moved Temporarily
          400               Bad Request
          404               Not Found
```

The HTTP reply also contains a set of other header lines, at least:
```
     Content-Type: text/html
     Content-Length: 1354
```

With the former indicating that the following Optional Data is a html file, and the latter (`Content-Length`) indicating the size (in octets) of this Optional Data. The HTTP reply may also contain other header lines, such as:
```
     Date: Thu, 15 Sep 2011 07:00:20 GMT
     Server: gws
```
The reply that would result from the HTTP request example above is included below:
```
     HTTP/1.1 302 Found<CR><LF>
     Location: http://www.google.fr/<CR><LF>
     Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8<CR><LF>
     Content-Length: 218<CR><LF>
     Date: Thu, 15 Sep 2011 07:00:20 GMT<CR><LF>
     Server: gws<CR><LF>
     Content-Length: 218<CR><LF>
     X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block<CR><LF>
     <CR><LF>
     <......the HTML page .....>
```
As it can be seen, `www.google.com` must have detected that this request was made from France and determined that the requestee should rather contact a french server - sending a `302` error code, and indicating in the `Location:` header that the server to contact should be `www.google.fr`.

Two questions to ponder:
- How would google know that the request was made from France?
- Why does google return a 302 "Moved Temporarily", rather than a 301 "Moved Permanently" ?
  
## Playing with HTTP 

### Exercise 1 - Testing with Telnet

#### Activity 1.0. 
For testing-purposes, you can try to use the Unix command `telnet` to establish a TCP connection to any port on a server. For example:
```bash
     telnet 137.194.211.148 80
```
You can then type commands:
```bash
GET /cyber/ HTTP/1.1
host: 137.194.211.148:80

``` 
finishing with an empty line to state the HTTP header is ended. On the keyboard and inspect the exact replies that the Web server generates. This is a good exercise to do. And, it works for all ASCII-based protocols running over `TCP` - such as, for example, `IRC`, `SMTP`, `POP` and `IMAP`. One of your teachers is occasionally seen reading his email using telnet to port 110... (Unless you suffer from the same disorder, it is advisable to have first a look at the telnet man page... to make it short, *security issues*).

#### Activity 1.1.
You may wonder why we need to add the "host:" field, which seems pretty redundant (since we telnet already to this server name). Let's try a little strange experiment to get convinced it is not useless at all: 
```console
% telnet scot-lille-metropole.org 80
Trying 176.31.252.106...
Connected to scot-lille-metropole.org.
Escape character is '^]'.
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: ip-paris.fr 

``` 
And observe the answer. You should see that the server from `scot-lille-metropole.org` does not seem to be worried to answer for `ip-paris.fr`. How do you explain this ?  
(*hint*: you may consider trying to `telnet www.polytechnique.edu` and `www.ip-paris.fr` to better understand what's going on). 

#### Activity 1.2. Binaries. 
You probably know that http is used to request all sort of content, not only plain text. In fact, most of the http traffic is video ! Your smart TV most likely use HTTP when you watch video on demand (VoD), constantly requesting the next video "chunks" (small segment of video lasting only a few seconds), that will have to be displayed soon on the screen. Let's request an image:

```console
jean-louis@Clibou ~ % telnet 137.194.211.148 80
Trying 137.194.211.148...
Connected to tcp.
Escape character is '^]'.
GET /nginx-logo.png HTTP/1.0  
Host: 137.194.211.148
```

What is the `content-type` in the answer ? 

As you can see, the content is in binary format (not possible to be displayed properly on a terminal). When we said previously that HTTP is an `ascii`-type protocol, we meant that the *headers* are in clear text (making it so easy to debug and to add extensions for instance). However, once the header is ended (with the empty line), it is possible to send arbitrary content, in binary format. The `content-type` field will allow the browser to understand how to deal with the content received (whether it a *zip* compressed file or video or image for instance).  

### Activity 1.3 (optional). 
You can have fun and start looking at real-world web sites... A few examples of sites which accept HTTP requests (most sites only accept `https` nowadays, we'll deal with this latter on in exercice 2). 
```console
telnet info.cern.ch  80 
telnet www.google.fr 80
```
will also work (*caution*: quite a long answers for Google!!!). Note that `info.cern.ch` is the oldest web page in the world (since the web and http were invented there around 1989-1991). An historical perspective is offered there, if you're interested. 


*Remark*: `Telnet` is very useful to try to understand how things work, as you type the request yourself (you are playing the role of a web browser). It is also handsome to make strange experiments (say with 'host' which do not correspond to the server requested, as we did before in activity 1.1).
Once the behavior of HTTP has no more secret for you, you could consider using tools which are easier to use, such as `curl` (or eventually `wget`).
*Example:*
```bash 
curl -i http://137.194.211.148:80/
```
where the `-i` option allows you see the HTTP header as well (not only the content of the answer). If you're only interested in the HTTP header of the answer, you can use:
```bash
     curl -I http://137.194.211.148:80/cyber/
```
The `-v` option will also make the output more verbose (you'll also see the `HTTP Request` for instance).
Curl is extensively used by developers, when working in the context of distributed applications/cloud (HTTP is also used to communicate between different programs over the Internet). 

## Exercise 2 - Testing with arbitrary sites

As you probably have seen at this stage, if you try to reach your preferred sites with the methods proposed above, most sites will only answer with a redirect (301 or 302) answer, pointing to a URL with the `https` protocol. It means that the site no longer support uncrypted/unauthenticated web communications. `https` actually refers to secured web transfers, allowing to authenticate the server (by means for certificates) and to encrypt traffic (for privacy). How this is achieved is beyond the scope of this course (it will be covered in other courses in the Cyber program). However, it is still possible to "play", as `HTTPS` consists simply of HTTP over a secure connection (`TLS`). We can open such a secure connection with the linux command: 
```bash
openssl s_client -connect -I www.polytechnique.fr:443
```
(some cabalistic symbols will be displayed, we won't comment on them...) then a secure connection is opened with the web server and we can simply continue, as before with telnet:
```bash
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: www.polytechnique.edu

```
finishing by an empty line, by pressing `<enter>`...

*Cautious*: you'll get a very long answer !!!

This will allow us to play with a any web server... 

### Activity 2.1: A funny HTTP header...
Curiosity is sometimes rewarded. Here is the http header obtained for the wired.com (tech magazine) last year (it longer works unfortunately, so we provide the communication below): 
```console
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: www.wired.com

HTTP/1.1 200 OK

There are many things in this header (*most of which we don't need to understand !*). But you can find a job offer hidden in this HTTP header (a clever way to find geeks interesting in internet protocols.. It's something that is not printed in your browser !!! so one need to be curious to see it).
*How is it possible ?* If a browser does not understand a keyword in the header, (say x-developer: for instance), this line will simply be ignored. Very flexible to add new features on new browsers... (or to hide job offers in this case !)... Some fields are proprietary for instance (added by some large content delivery network providers for instance). 

#### Cookies


![Delete Cookies !!!](./images/cookie-monster-small.jpg "Delete Cookies!!!")


One can see they are many *cookies* (visible with the `Set-Cookie:` keyword). In a nutshell, a cookie is simply a piece of Data sent by the server. Your browser generally stores this data and will send it back at each successive requests to this site (if you accept these cookies). This will potentially allow the site to correlate the different requests, for better or worse !!!

*Remark*. Why cookies ? HTTP is stateless, in other words a HTTP receiver does not store any state on the previous requests, for the sake of simplicity and scalability. Each successive HTTP request is thus treated independently from each other. This means that the request must contain all relevant information such as it can be understood autonomously by the server --- which eventually requires a unique id (present in a cookie) associated with a shopping cart for instance, in an electronic commerce shop... 

### Activity 2.2 Caching

It is interesting to have a look at the "caching" strategies of different web pages. For instance for polytechnique.edu :
```
cache-control: max-age=10800, public
```
A cache is a hardware or software component where objects can be temporarily stored, so that further requests can be served faster. If the a content is requested, one can first check whether it is not already in the 'cache'. You have by default  a cache in your web-browser (it's sometimes called a *private* cache) meaning that content may be directly displayed from the cache, without requiring an HTTP request being sent on the network. 
Of course, one needs to control the freshness of the content. In the example showed, content can be stored in cache for a maximum of 3 hours max (hence 10800 seconds). Some sites will indicate `max-age=0`. It does not necessarily mean that content can not be cached locally (`no-store` must be explicitly specified to avoid caching), but an HTTP request is needed to check whether the content has changed or not since the date it was received, before eventually using the local copy (including a `If-Not-Modified` option in the HTTP header). 

Web servers (such as *nginx*) make also an extensive use of caching. Instead of building the web page requested (which might require access to databases, file systems, ...), the server will first check whether a local copy is not already available in memory... 

Caching is thus an essential component for scaling in the Internet. It is also the basis of Content Delivery Networks, hosting popular contents using a large number of web servers, scattered in hundreds of localisation in the world (named pop: point of presence). 

### Activity 2.3. A strange HTTP Request v2 ("Domain Fronting"). 

Let's try to connect to `www.liberation.fr` and then request to read the content (front page) of `www.lefigaro.fr`. It looks crazy, right ? (These two journals are not from the same press group --- and represent different political opinions...) Well... not so crazy. 
Let's try:
```bash
openssl s_client -connect www.liberation.fr:443
```
(… the TLS connection will be set-up, we will ignore these messages …)
```bash
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: www.lefigaro.fr 

```
(finish with an empty line). What do you observe ? How can you explain this ? 

*Note*: We'll come back to this example latter on in the DNS Lab. We'll understand how we knew it should work...

For information (out of scope of this course, optional), this is a basic example of techniques called *domain fronting*, used to circumvent Internet censorship in some countries. Content is hidden behind large content distribution networks, which makes censorship difficult or impossible (without banning all the content which might also be hosted by the same content distribution providers)... 

*Remark*. As previously explained for `telnet`, we can use also the `curl` tool once we have understood how things work, as an alternative to the manual procedure introduced earlier, for example: 
```bash
curl -I https://www.wired.com:443/
```
